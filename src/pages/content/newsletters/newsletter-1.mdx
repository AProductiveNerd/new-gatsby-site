   <li>This article has been a nice one</li>
   <li>Here are my highlight but the summary is basically, apply the Zettelkasten method and maybe use something like Roam Research.<ul>
   <li>Progressive Summarization is a specific process of reading, bolding, highlighting, summarizing, and then finally, possibly, rewriting.</li>
   <li>Progressive Summarization encourages the same thing as the industrial factory-based education system: the production of poor thinkers who are skilled in the regurgitation of other people‚Äôs ideas</li>
   <li>Instead it could have gone to developing your own nuanced perspective to the ideas you encounter, then connecting them with other ideas you‚Äôve already encountered. Let‚Äôs call this‚Ä¶</li>
   <li>Progressive Ideation.</li>
   <li><ul>
   <li>Why care? </li>
   </ul>
   </li>
   <li>The very essence and quality of our thinking is at stake. Why relegate your best thinking to the last step in an elaborate process? If you are a knowledge worker, an entrepreneur, or just someone who likes to think ‚Äî Progressive Summarization must die.</li>
   <li><ul>
   <li>Progressive Summarization Creates False Confidence </li>
   </ul>
   </li>
   <li>The Collector‚Äôs Fallacy ‚Äî coined by Christian Tietze ‚Äî argues that the act of ‚Äúcollecting‚Äù is easy. It feels like progress but it‚Äôs not.</li>
   <li>The same is true with the act of ‚Äúsummarizing‚Äù. Let‚Äôs call it‚Ä¶</li>
   <li>The Summarizer‚Äôs Fallacy.</li>
   <li>The last major reason why Progressive Summarization must die is that it doesn‚Äôt effectively grow and evolve with you over time.</li>
   <li><ul>
   <li>In summary‚Ä¶ </li>
   </ul>
   </li>
   <li>1. Progressive Summarization creates a false sense of achievement.  </li>
   <li>2. Progressive Summarization encourages regurgitative thinking.  </li>
   <li>3. Progressive Summarization doesn‚Äôt build a dynamic digital library.</li>
   <li><ul>
   <li>What is Progressive Ideation </li>
   </ul>
   </li>
   <li>Progressive Summarization is: ‚ÄúCopy, Bold, Highlight, Summarize, Rewrite.‚Äù</li>
   <li>Progressive Ideation is: ‚ÄúComment, Convert, Connect, Create.‚Äù</li>
   <li>For the sake of the quality of your thinking, the difference is night and day.</li>
   <li>Make comments (and highlights) as you go. </li>
   <li>Convert them into new notes. </li>
   <li><ul>
   <li>Progressive Ideation Creates Real Value </li>
   </ul>
   </li>
   <li>When you read something new, what if you added comments as you went? (Nothing major, just some comments like you were having an engaging conversation with a friend.) </li>
   <li>What if you converted some of that information into new notes, each representing a new idea, each written in your own words? </li>
   <li>What if you then linked these new ideas to existing ideas in your note library? </li>
   <li><ul>
   <li>Progressive Ideation Encourages Connective Thinking </li>
   </ul>
   </li>
   </ul>

   </ul>
