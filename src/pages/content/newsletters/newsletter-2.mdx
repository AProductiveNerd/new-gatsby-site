<a href="https://andymatuschak.org/">Andy Matuschak&#39;s website</a>

I also discovered Andy Matuschak&#39;s website! The only expression
which I can give is &quot;Why didn&#39;t I discover this before!!&quot;

The concept of evergreen notes has been phenomenal to me. I will share
my experience in using them in a future article.

The website is also of such a great design!

    It has the beauty of a blank page inviting you to write, to think, to
    create. But that page becomes part of a multitude of pages, a polyphonic
    composition rich with echoes, resonances, interactions and harmonies.

  Being literate ‚â† being a reader ‚Äî Jen Vermet
</a>

Here are my highlights from the article

School teaches kids how to become literate. It does not teach them
how to become readers. In reality, school traumatizes readers.

Ironically, the same institution that is supposed to inspire kids to
become curious about education creates the opposite effect.

As Gustave Flaubert shared in 1867, ‚ÄúDo not read, as children do, to
amuse yourself, or like the ambitious, for the purpose of
instruction. No, read in order to live.‚Äù

Naval Ravikant&#39;s practical theory for reading is to see how many
ideas he can understand and use. It is better to reread the best 100
books and know those ideas really well than read all the books.

Spark the fire for your love of reading even if school took that
away. Afterall, reading is the closest humanity has to time-travel.
