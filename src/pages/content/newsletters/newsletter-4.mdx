This whole web-development class sharing leads nicely to the next topic

<h2 id="an-announcement">An announcement</h2>

People that teach how to code know how to code. They have been doing this for
ages, but with experience, the sense of being a beginner fades away. You hear
people say just dabble around with the code and you will learn how to code. I
myself am guilty of that in my article

<a href="/Articles/The-myth-about-coding">The Myth about Programming</a>. So now
I am learning JS and more specifically React myself. So I have thought to
document my experience with this. I literally do not know anything about JS. So
come along with me and see how I dabble around and figure things out

At the end we will see judge my learning by converting this very website into
a React app with a working search feature which should allow you to search
through the names of the articles. I will also use Google Tag Manager for
this.

I have always been wanting to do this. I thought of taking up this challenge
myself but while casually browising twitter I see this!

    orphans is a rarely used function in Roam that shows you list of blocks that
    can‚Äôt be found on a page because they lost their parent. Sometimes surfaces
    some old gems.

Orphan blocks! So this has only happened to me once, I typed up a large
research document and puff Roam crashed and the document was deleted. And
now, I tried orphans and I got those blocks back! Only if I had known this a
month ago, I wouldn't have had to do everything again
