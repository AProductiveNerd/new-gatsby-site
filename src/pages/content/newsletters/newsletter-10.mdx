## Reading Review

This week I managed to finish Book: How to take smart notes and Book: Six of crows. And I am about half way through Book: How to Develop Self Confidence and Improve Public speaking, Book: Think Like a Monk, Book: The Obstacle Is the Way.

My detailed notes for Book: How to take smart notes will be available shortly as currently I am in the middle of re-coding my website with exciting features like search!

## Weekly Favourites

**Software** - Readwise. I know this is repetitive and I have been going on and on about readwise for quite a while now but to be honest I just can't stop singing its praise. For the Book: How to take smart notes I made my first ever detailed evergreen notes. I loved the process especially because readwise just painlessly synced my highlights from my kindle to Roam Research. This is world changing because now I can block reference these notes in my Evergreen(Permanent) notes!

**More Software** - I can't just get over software can I? This time it... Roam42. It is a great extension which kinda supercharges Roam Research(as if we Roam needed to be supercharged). But it seriously adds a lot of new functionality to Roam Research primarily because of its focus on keyboard shortcuts. Being a productive nerd, you want to minimize the time between thinking of an action to do on the computer and the action being done. Now, if I want to go to a particular date, I just need to hit Alt-Shift-j and boom I am picking dates!! Do I want to convert a piece of writing(like this newsletter!) to markdown without bullet points? Just hit Alt-m and Roam42 does it all for you.

    <br />
    Markdown links now work for aliasing Roam&#39;s internal links
    <br />
    <br />
    so you can point to a particular block - and rather than embed its full
    content - alias it to a variable or footnote number or w/e.
