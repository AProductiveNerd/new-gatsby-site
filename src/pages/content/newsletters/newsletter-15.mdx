## Announcement

This very site, that you are viewing is now a PWA and can work offline. The offline part still has a lot of room to improve but I would love if you were to check it out and give me some suggestions. You can see the contact links in the footer down below.

## Weekly favourites

**Instapaper** - Instapaper is essentially a save to read-later app. The main reason I have started using Instapaper for is to take notes on articles.

I have been deeply interested in the writing part and I hope that in the coming articles my writing improves
