    Now you are pretty convinced that you need to fall asleep but there is a
    huge problem sometimes. Sometimes, you just can&#39;t fall asleep. No matter
    how hard you try it just seems impossible. This is a problem that I have
    faced a number of times before. But now, I have a magic strategy that you
    can use in order to fall asleep faster. That magic strategy is...Counting
    till you fall asleep. I am kidding. I have counted to a thousand at one
    night and still couldn&#39;t fall asleep. So lets approach this logically.
  </li>
  <li>
    There are two main reasons that prohibit you to fall asleep, the environment
    and your brain. First, lets look at the environment because that will effect
    your brain.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Environment
    <ul>
      <li>
        So there is a hormone called Melatonin. You may have heard of it.
        Basically, what it does is that it tells your brain that it is now dark
        and you should fall asleep. Now you may realise how important this
        hormone is. Now what is the problem here? The problem as you may have
        guessed is that this hormone gets released when it is
        <strong>DARK</strong> but, in this day and age, our society is a darkness-deprived
        one.
      </li>

        I know I know, this isn&#39;t something that you probably wanted to
        hear. You have to not watch TV at night. Keep your phones in silent mode
        and put them away. I know that this requires a lot of self-discipline
        and effort. While putting your phone away you may think what if someone
        messages me? But the truth is really that no one mostly needs an urgent
        reply at night. Everyone can wait. If it is so necessary then you can
        choose to only mute messages not calls. If it is a message then it can
        most probably wait.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now, one more giant thing which you can do is follow a consistent
        schedule. You <strong>SHOULD</strong> to fall asleep and then wake up at
        the same time everyday no matter if it is a weekend or not. This is a
        common mistake that people make in constructing a sleep schedule, The
        mistake is that they often think that I can be easier on weekends. It is
        not that you should get your healthy 8 hours of sleep only on weekends
        and try to sleep less in weekdays. Sleep depravation can&#39;t be
        accumulated only to sorted later. Once gone, sleep <strong>IS</strong>
        gone. I repeat, it <strong>IS</strong> gone.
      </li>
      <li>
        As I addressed earlier, it is very hard to have that kind of
        self-discipline which allows you to resist the urge for you to use your
        phone. For this I recommend that you take a look at my
        <a href="How to build habits that stick">
          How to build habits that stick
        </a>
        article. Building a bedtime is still a habit.

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The Brain
    <ul>
      <li>
        The problem sometimes is that sometimes, the brain just doesn&#39;t want
        to shut down. It forces you to re-live your whole day. It forces you to
        turn over problems in your head. This can not only be anxiety inducing
        but it also leads to sleep-depravation which as you know is very very
        dangerous.
      </li>
      <li>
        So how do you fight this problem? The main principle to fight this is
        filling your intentional space with just enough load that it keeps it
        full but not so full that you basically solving hard maths problems at
        the end. You can learn more about intentional space and attention in
        general in the book
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperfocus-Manage-Attention-World-Distraction/dp/0525522255/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=hyperfocus&amp;qid=1590737565&amp;sr=8-1">

        This is where the 4-3-5 breathing method comes in. The original method
        is called the 4-7-8 breathing method. In the 4-7-8 method, you have to
        inhale while counting till 4 then you have to hold your breath while
        counting till 7 and then exhale while counting till 8. I find this
        method a bit excessive so I tend to use the 4-3-5 method. You have to
        count till 4 while inhaling then hold your breath counting till 3 and
        exhale while counting till 5. Now this may seem kinda sketchy
        considering the fact that you are still basically counting but this is a
        method which I have used and it works really well because it involves
        mindfulness.
